# 1 Make a program that lists the countries in the set below using a while loop
listc = ["canada", "USA", "Mexico"]
i = 0
while i < len(listc):
    print(listc[i])
    i = i+1

# 2 sum the numbers using while loop
number = 1
sum = 0
while number <= 10:
    sum = sum + number
    print(sum)
    number += 1

# 3 for loop inside while loop
# yes we can use for loop inside while loop

# 4 The major difference between for loop and the
# while loop is that for loop is used when the number of iterations is known, whereas
# execution is done in the while loop until the statement in the program is proved wrong.
